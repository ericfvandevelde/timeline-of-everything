#Timeline of Everything

Timeline of Everything allows you to create timelines and compare them with other ones to potentially find interesting new things.

#Installation

To set it up, you need [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/).

Once Python is in your environment variables, verify you have it by running:

```sh
$ python -V
```

Next, install the dependencies by running:

```sh
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have a Windows system, I have written two helper .bat files that will run the next commands for you.

To reset the database (always do this for the first time or when there's an error in the database), run the runAndReset.bat file, otherwise run the run.bat file.
